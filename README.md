# I like worse code

I like `printBasic` more than `printFactored`, even though `printFactored` is what I've been recommending for years.

## Reasons to like the factored version

- Reads like English.
- Clear separation.
- Self documenting.
- Clear what depends on what.

## Reasons to dislike factored version

- I can't see everything that's happening at once.

## Reasons to like the basic version

- Everything is right in front of me.

## Reasons to dislike the basic version

- Just look at it! _Way_ too much going on.

## Additional thoughts

- Comments can lie. But so can function names.
